# variables
# A variable is a container or a storage area that holds data.
# A variable can store any data eg number, name, mathematical values

# Assigning values to variables in python
name = "John Doe"
age = 30

print("My name is",name,"I am",age,"years old")
# Name and age are the variables and john doe and 30 are values so name and age are containers.
